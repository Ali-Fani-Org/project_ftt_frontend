# Custom notification sounds directory (Future Feature)
# This directory is reserved for user-provided custom notification sounds
# 
# Note: This is a placeholder for future functionality.
# Currently, only default sounds in the 'default/' directory are supported.
#
# When custom sounds are implemented, users will be able to:
# - Upload their own sound files
# - Map custom sounds to notification types
# - Override default sounds on a per-type basis
